Data
For this project we need the following data:
•	New York City data that contains list Boroughs, Neighborhoods along with their latitude and longitude.
	Data source: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset
	Description: This data set contains the required information. And we will use this data set to explore various neighborhoods of New York City.
•	Turkish restaurants in each neighborhood of New York City.
	Data source: Foursquare API
	Description: By using this API we will get all the venues in each neighborhood. We can filter these venues to get only Turskih restaurants.
•	GeoSpace data
	Data source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm
