Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods â€“ week I

Introduction
I chose New York City because of two things. First, the data of this city can be very easy collected and the second New York City is the largest city in the United States with a long history of international immigration. New York City was home to nearly 8.5 million people in 2014, accounting for over 40% of the population of New York State and a slightly lower percentage of the New York metropolitan area, home to approximately 23.6 million. Over the last decade the city has been growing faster than the region. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.
Throughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term "melting pot" was coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. English remains the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.
Diversity of population in the City generated different needs and services especially when it comes to food. Due to this, there are many restaurants in New York City, each belonging to different categories like Turkish, Chinese, Turkish, French, etc. The main aim of my project is to find, estimate and visualize all major parts of New York City that has good Turkish restaurants. It can be useful to future owners of the restaurants for finding potentially good area in order to open a new one.
